### About

Hi, I am Aaditya Dhruv, a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studying Computer Science.
<br>
<br>
My main interests lie in Systems Programming and Network Engineering. I am also interested in Linux, open-source software, and self-hosting. In fact, this website is [open-source](https://github.com/aadityadhruv/website) and is hosted on my Linux homelab! 
<br>
<br>
I enjoy tinkering around in my homelab, learning new technologies and hosting various [services](https://dashboard.aadityadhruv.com) instead of relying on 3rd-party software. 
<br>
<br>
A lot of the code that drives my homelab is open-source, and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/aadityadhruv)!
<br>

### Posts

I often make posts on this website about various topics.  I mainly write about my homelab and the new things I learn or I find interesting. I also like making posts about some interesting projects I'm working on.

I am currently working on making some old-gen console emulators with Rust :crab:, which is going great!
