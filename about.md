### Resume


Here is my [Resume](/assets/Resume.pdf), which you can also find on my LinkedIn!


### Techincal Details

The website itself is a Jekyll Docker container serving static Markdown files. These files are available on my GitHub.

The server I run this on is my personal homelab, which also hosts a bunch of my other services. It is running on a Rocky Linux server.


With Markdown support, writing pages and posts is simplified. I am also currently working on hooking up this Repo to my personal Gitea instance, which is connected to my CI Drone server. With this workflow, I aim to be able to deploy changes to the website by simply pushing changes to the repository!
