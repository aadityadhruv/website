### Resume


Here is my [Resume](/assets/Resume.pdf), which you can also find on my LinkedIn!


### Techincal Details

The website is just static files generated by Jekyll. These files are available on my GitHub.

The server I run this on is my personal homelab, which also hosts a bunch of my other services. It is running on a Rocky Linux server.


With Markdown support, writing pages and posts is simplified. This Repo is also hosted on my personal Gitea instance, which is connected to my CI Drone server. This setup lets me deploy changes to the website by simply pushing changes to this repository!
