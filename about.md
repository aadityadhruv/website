### Resume


Here is my [Resume](/assets/Resume.pdf), which you can also find on my LinkedIn!


### Techincal Details

The website is just static files generated by Jekyll. These files are available on my GitHub.

The server I run this on is my personal homelab, which also hosts a bunch of my other services. It is running on a Rocky Linux server.


With Markdown support, writing pages and posts is simplified. This Repo is also hosted on my personal [Gitea](https://git.aadityadhruv.com/aadityadhruv/website) instance, which is connected to my [CI Drone](https://dev.aadityadhruv.com/aadityadhruv/website) server. This setup lets me deploy changes to the website by simply pushing changes to this repository!
