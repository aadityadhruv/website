### Personal Website


This is the source code for my personal [website](https://aadityadhruv.com). It runs in a Jekyll Docker container running on my homeserver. 


The purpose of this repository is not just to open-source the website, but also keep a record of all changes and posts on the website, and also allow for easy access to make new posts via the git repository.
