### Personal Website


This is the source code for my personal [website](https://aadityadhruv.com). It is hosted as a static website on my homeserver, and is generated using Jekyll. The builds can be seen here[drone](https://dev.aadityadhruv.com/aadityadhruv/website)


The purpose of this repository is not just to open-source the website, but also keep a record of all changes and posts on the website, and also allow for easy access to make new posts via the git repository.
