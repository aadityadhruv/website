I"{<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hi, I am Aaditya Dhruv, a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studying Computer Science.
<br />
<br />
My main interests lie in Systems Programming and Network Engineering. I am also interested in Linux, open-source software, and self-hosting. In fact, this website is <a href="https://github.com/aadityadhruv/website">open-source</a> and is hosted on my Linux homelab! 
<br />
<br />
I enjoy tinkering around in my homelab, learning new technologies and hosting various <a href="https://dashboard.aadityadhruv.com">services</a> instead of relying on 3rd-party software. 
<br />
<br />
A lot of the code that drives my homelab is open-source, and can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/aadityadhruv">GitHub</a>!
<br />
<br /></p>
<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>

<p>I often make posts on this website about various topics.  I mainly write about my homelab and the new things I learn or I find interesting. I also like making posts about some interesting projects I’m working on.</p>

<p>I am currently working on making some old-gen console emulators with Rust :crab:, which is going great!
