<p>Here is my <a href="/assets/Resume.pdf">Resume</a>, which you can also find on my LinkedIn!</p>

<h3 id="techincal-details">Techincal Details</h3>

<p>The website itself is a Jekyll Docker container serving static Markdown files. These files are available on my GitHub.</p>

<p>The server I run this on is my personal homelab, which also hosts a bunch of my other services. It is running on a Rocky Linux server.</p>

<p>With Markdown support, writing pages and posts is simplified. I am also currently working on hooking up this Repo to my personal Gitea instance, which is connected to my CI Drone server. With this workflow, I aim to be able to deploy changes to the website by simply pushing changes to the repository!</p>
